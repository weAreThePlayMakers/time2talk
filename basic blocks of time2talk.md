## Main idea again

The app follows the idea encapsulated in the slogan "you don't need to be professional to talk about mental health" and the intention is to give people with mental health problems ability to easily access the simplest form of support that is positive and friendly conversations with an open minded and willing to listen individual.

## Registration

On registration `user` is asked about their preferences as to a `meeting point`.

These would need to be verified by either moderator or other users and users who would tag surrounding public places using publicly available info from Google maps and from social media platforms etc. In this way every `meeting point` would gain a `profile`.

The idea is for these `meeting points` to be public, free to use and casual/low profile allowing both users to feel comfortable, relaxed and positive.

Similarly there would be a need for some info about `users` but the general idea is for them to be anonymous so to minimise any potential inhibitions. So very simple `user icon` as in topeka would do, a `name` and maybe a `favourite quote` or something similarity low profile.

## Admin

There would obviously be the `admin` side of `user profile` which we would tuck in a spreadsheet to annoy "serious developers". The `process` would be rather simple and no checks against police database are going to make the cut. We are more inclined towards `community based` and `inclusive policy` which asks for `basic information` and looks at `social network profile` and these details are really just in case.

In the end it's about getting a partner for a walk in the park and nothing more. The convos could have specified `time limit` and are intended to be rather casual and both individuals will be able to stay anonymous if they chose to.
